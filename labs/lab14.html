In Above Viedo clip we can see two players playing badminton  continously.Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" with one player per side and "doubles" with two players per side. Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judgeThe court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only.The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the same length.<span class="span"> The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.</span>
