         <h1>Athlete1:- Aleksander Zubkov(RUS),Bobsled</h1>
         <p>
          Zubkov, 39, had a built-in advantage of having six or seven times more runs than Holcomb on the Sanki Sliding Center track than 2010 Olympic four-man champion Steven Holcomb, the American estimated.
          Still, Zubkov should be commended for his sweep after Holcomb and Germanyâ€™s Max Arndt had been the best drivers over the World Cup season.
          He had the fastest sled in six of eight total runs over two- and four-man races and had both gold medals secured before the final run barring major mistakes.
          Zubkov became the sixth man to sweep the two- and four-man Olympic events and the second non-German, joining the Italian great Eugenio Monti.
