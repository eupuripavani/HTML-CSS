                    <h2>My Opinion</h2>
                    <p class="columns">
                     Drone strikes create more terrorists than they kill.Drone strikes target individuals who may not be terrorists or enemy combatants.Drone strikes kill large numbers of civilians and traumatize local populations.Drone strikes mostly kill low-value targets who are not significant threats to US safety and security.Drone strikes violate international law.Drone strikes are secretive, lack sufficient legal oversight, and prevent citizens from holding their leaders accountable.Drone strikes violate the sovereignty of other countries.
