				<p>i kept small elephant as my background image, i felt it is cute.Elephants are mammals of the family Elephantidae and the largest existing land animals. Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons.The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar&#45;like legs carry their great weight.Elephants belong to the family Elephantidae, the sole remaining family within the order Proboscidea which belongs to the superorder Afrotheria. Their closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they share the clade Paenungulata within the superorder Afrotheria and i have taken this information from internet in order to show my background image.
