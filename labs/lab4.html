Because in wish shipping is very late and there will be no proper responce. even though priecs are very less, but i never felt quality is good. and when ever i orderd in bulky some of them will not arrive.and customer support will not respond back.<p style="color:hotpink;">waste of time and money spending on this website, because previously like two or 3 months before i ordered so many items from wish which i didnt receive upto now.The items which i purchased are not what is described or of the quality it states. Wrong sizes, poorly designed graphics, the material used is very poor.</p>also the retail price is very less. I should have read the reviews before I purchased over $30.00 worth of products I would have saved if purchased through local retailers.</p>
