					<h1>Facebook addiction?</h1>

					<h1>Example from news of a person who was "addicted" to using facebook&#45;why was their behavior considered addictive?</h1>
					<p>It’s obvious that what social media does to us, especially those of us who are heavy users, is not natural, or normal. It’s not normal to submit opinions for approval every day to an online crowd, nor is it normal to consume the opinions of strangers in bulk. It’s not normal to live under the surveillance of software companies, which tailor their advertising with such eerie precision that it seems impossible that they are not listening in on our conversations. It’s definitely not normal to wake in the night to use social media, or to spend roughly 24 hours a week on it, returning again and again even though it can make us feel depressed and alone. None of these behaviours were normal a few decades ago, nor are they especially useful to us today, but they’re practised by billions of people across the world.</p>

					<h1> Were they able to modify their behavior? Have you ever been concerned about becoming addicted to any Internet activites?</h1>
					<p>The present study aimed to investigate Facebook Addiction Disorder&#45;(FAD)&#45;in a German student sample over a period of one year. While mean FAD level did not increase during the investigation period, a significant increase was shown in the number of participants reaching the critical cutoff score. FAD was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms). Furthermore, FAD fully mediated the significant positive relationship between narcissism and stress symptoms, which demonstrates that narcissistic people can be specifically at risk to develop FAD. Present results give a first overview of FAD in Germany. Practical applications for future studies and limitations of present results are discussed.Addiction is a strong word, and someone can have a problem with Facebook without having a full&#45;blown addiction. Some call this emerging type of addictive behavior "Facebook addiction disorder" or FAD, but the syndrome is not widely acknowledged as a psychological disorder, though it is being studied by psychologists.<span class="span">Facebook Addiction is also referred to as Addicted to Facebook, Internet addiction, Facebook addiction disorder, Facebook addiction syndrome, Facebook addict, Facebook OCD, Facebook fanatic, lost in Facebook.A small number of studies associate social network site addiction with health&#45;related, academic, and interpersonal problems. Those who use social networks excessively may have a decrease in real life social community participation</span>
