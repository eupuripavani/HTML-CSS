                    Now a days Cooking&#45;Channel is an entertainment<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/healthy-pre-thanksgiving-indian-dinner-cooking-demo-sun-nov-24th-4pm-tickets-79291580251">Thanksgiving Indian dinner</a> dedicated to today's passionate food lover</li>.
                    <li> For the food people, by the people, cooking channel is the answer to a growing hunger. And cooking in every dimension from global cuisines to international level. I started this channel because, when I got married in 2017. I dont know anything about cooking before marriage.<a href="https://www.cookingchanneltv.com">Coocking channel</a></li>
                    <li> My mom she sooks for me but after marriage I have to cook for someone (husband's family or relatives, friends) which I dont know, so everyday to cook any dish I will search in Google or Youtube and follow there ideas to cook. So I thought my channel will help others who are new to cooking to learn and cook simple and easy dishes.</li>
                    <li> In receipes I provided food names for chicken and sea food and also some veg foods with sweets these are Indian style. In further after learning other dishes I will update in my page.<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wfpb-living-foods-that-build-your-vitamin-shield-lecture-cooking-demo-tickets-70179858847">Foods Build Your Vitamin</a>

                    Food is what people and animals eat to survive. Food usually comes from animals and plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition.Food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy.The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans. It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called "drinks". If someone cannot afford food they go hungry.<a href="https://www.tastecooking.com/art-cooking-demo-disaster/">Tasty</a>Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs, and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called vegetarianism. Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism.
                    Many cultures or religions have food taboos. That means they have rules what people should not eat, or how the food has to be prepared. Examples of religious food rules are the Kashrut of Judaism and the Halal of Islam, that say that pig meat cannot be eaten. In Hinduism, eating beef is not allowed. Some Christians are vegetarian (someone who does not eat meat) because of their religious beliefs. For example, Seventh-day Adventist Church recommends vegetarianism<a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/students/highschool/chemistryclubs/activities/food-and-chemistry.html">Food and Coocking Chemistry</a>

            <h1>Follow these Steps for a Simple Rice recipe.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx7sxWI9FNI">Rice Makeing Viedo</a></h1>
             <p>
                <ol>
                <li>Boil water and add salt. After you rinse your rice, pour fresh water (for every cup of rice, use 1¾ cups of water) into a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
                <li>Pour in rice.</li>
                <li>Stir once, or just enough to separate the rice.Use a wooden spoon to separate any clumps. Don’t over-stir: That can cause the rice to become sticky</li>
                <li>Cover the pot and simmer.Be sure the lid fits tightly on the pot. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let rice simmer for about 18 minutes, then remove from heat and allow the rice to steam in the pot for another 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Fluff rice with a fork.Just before serving, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains. And after you've cooked up your perfect rice.</li>
