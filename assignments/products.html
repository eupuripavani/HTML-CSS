                Food is what people and animals eat to survive. Food usually comes from animals and plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition. Food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans. It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called   "drinks". If someone cannot afford food they go hungry.
                Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat animal origin food, like meat, eggs and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called vegetarianism. Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism. Many cultures or religions have food taboos. That means they have rules what people should not eat, or how the food has   to   be prepared.<a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/students/highschool/chemistryclubs/activities/food-and-chemistry.html">Food and Coocking Chemistry</a>

            <h1>Follow these Steps for a Simple Rice recipe.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx7sxWI9FNI">Rice Makeing Viedo</a></h1>
             <p>
                <ol>
                <li>Boil water and add salt. After you rinse your rice, pour fresh water (for every cup of rice, use 1¾ cups of water) into a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
                <li>Pour in rice.</li>
                <li>Stir once, or just enough to separate the rice.Use a wooden spoon to separate any clumps. Don’t over-stir: That can cause the rice to become sticky</li>
                <li>Cover the pot and simmer.Be sure the lid fits tightly on the pot. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let rice simmer for about 18 minutes, then remove from heat and allow the rice to steam in the pot for another 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Fluff rice with a fork.Just before serving, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains. And after you've cooked up your perfect rice.</li>
