                Food is what people and animals eat to survive. Food usually comes from animals and plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition. Food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans. It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called   "drinks". If someone cannot afford food they go hungry.<a href="https://www.cookingchanneltv.com">Coocking channel</a>
                Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat animal origin food, like meat, eggs and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called vegetarianism. Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism. Many cultures or religions have food taboos. That means they have rules what people should not eat, or how the food has   to   be prepared.

                The above is coocking viedo for demo.Cooking is the art of preparing food for ingestion, commonly with the application of heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, reflecting unique environments, economics, cultural traditions, and trends. The way that cooking takes place also depends on the skill and type of training of an individual cook.Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans. It may have started around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence for it reaches no more than 1 million years ago.Naturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules called proteins, carbohydrates and fats. They also contain water and minerals. Cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of these molecules.

                The above is product demo viedo.First looking at an electric vegetable chopper, the Ninja NJ100 Express Chop features a simple, clean design with BPA-free construction. Best of all, it is priced under $30, making it an affordable electric chopper that’s a fraction of the cost of the average food processor, yet it closely mimics the function of one to an extent.The Ninja NJ100 offers the ability to chop, mince, and even puree ingredients. This is a great buy if you’re looking for a quality product not just for chopping or mincing vegetables but also to make salsas, dressings, pasta or dipping sauces, soups, or even for mincing herbs. This electric vegetable chopper only has one speed and a two-cup capacity; however, it features easy push-down ignition and patented Ninja blade technology to provide substantial power.According to reviewers, this Ninja product is great in that it doesn’t require a lot of pressure to operate, is very fast in getting things chopped/minced/pureed in just 3 to 5 seconds, and is easy to clean. That said, if you want an adequate chop, mince, or puree with a great motor, quick operation, and razor-sharp blades for top-notch performance, all within a lower price range, the Ninja NJ100 Express Chop proves itself to be a great product for many of your kitchen prep tasks.<a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/students/highschool/chemistryclubs/activities/food-and-chemistry.html">Food and Coocking Chemistry</a>

            <h1>Follow these Steps for a Simple Rice recipe.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx7sxWI9FNI">Rice Makeing Viedo</a></h1>
             <p>
                <ol>
                <li>Boil water and add salt. After you rinse your rice, pour fresh water (for every cup of rice, use 1¾ cups of water) into a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
                <li>Pour in rice.</li>
                <li>Stir once, or just enough to separate the rice.Use a wooden spoon to separate any clumps. Don’t over-stir: That can cause the rice to become sticky</li>
                <li>Cover the pot and simmer.Be sure the lid fits tightly on the pot. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let rice simmer for about 18 minutes, then remove from heat and allow the rice to steam in the pot for another 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Fluff rice with a fork.Just before serving, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains. And after you've cooked up your perfect rice.</li>
